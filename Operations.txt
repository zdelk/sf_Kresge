General Process of the Analysis:
1. .csv files are fulled from Attune. Making sure to use rounded timestamps
  -Files vizually inspected to ensure all the neccessary data is pulled
  -Completely blank columns (i.e. sensor wasnt connected) are removed
  -Check to see if resident likely smoked in the room (i.e. High Co2, Pm2.5, etc.)
    -If so noted and removed
  -Files should be organized by Pre and Post Renovation
  -Names of file should be standardized by location and status (i.e. Post_Albany, Prer_East_Lake, etc.)
    -Prer is used because one set of the code removes the first 5 characters which was easier than finding another way
    
2. Kresge_auto_agg_to_excel.R
- Using Non_Smoking Folder
  A) sum_up(combine_variables(data)) 
      -gives 5 num sum of all locations in the folder
      -Combines Sensors
      -Used the created Pre and Post excel sheets to create Kresge_tables_v3.xlsx
  B) do_both(combine_variables(data))
      -Uses 3 functions
        - combine_variables() combines like variables across a locations 
          (i.e. The Co2 data from each sensor is averaged for each time point and
          in a single column)
        - do_both()
          - convert_data(): tries a few ways to convert the data so it can be used
            for the hour aggregation
          - by_hour_agg(): aggregates the data by hour and standardized the names

3. Plot_everything.R
  - Takes in the output file from do_both() (.xlsx file with multiplesheets)
  - File is sent through multiplesheets() and turned into a list of dataframes
  - That list is sent through combine_similar_columns() where a master dataframe
    - This also subsets the data to the first 336 point (14 days) starting at noon for each location
    - All location are combined into one dataframe on the first noon datapoint (ID = 1)
  - That is done for both Pre and Post Reno output files
  - Then theses dataframes are merged into one
  - Long subsets are created using long_subset_maker()
    - Creates the long subset
    - Adds column for Pre or Post
    - Adds column for Location
    - Cleans varable name
  - GGplot format is created and turned into function
  - Each variable long subset is sent through the plot function
